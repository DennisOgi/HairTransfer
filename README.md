# HairTransfer is a python program that uses computer vision and deep learning to transfer hairstyle from one face to another.

Deep learning is applied to recognize faceshapes to customize user hairstyle feed to only consist of faces with similar face shape to ensure quality hairTransfer.

Tensorflow was used for Deep Learning. The Inception V3 Deep Learning Model was retrained to recognize five face shapes.
